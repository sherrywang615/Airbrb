Understandability:
I used placeholder in the form for create a new listing to help user s understand what kind of input is expected for each field.

Perceivability:
I used alt text for images and made the all text distinguishable.

Robustness:
I ensured that my html is parsable. There's no duplicate names and only relevant attributes are added to tags.

Operability:
I ensured that all forms and form elemnets are marked up correctly by using <form>, <label>, <input>, and <button> tags appropriately.
