1.I used different colors for different buttons to make them more distinguishable. For example, I used red for Delete and Unpublish button to tell the user to use extra caution when clicking these buttons. I used primary color for publish and edit buttons, and secondary color for manage bookings button.

2.I also used red, yellow, and green to indicate the status of a booking being declined, pending, or accepted.

3.I used different sizes for different text in the application to indicate the visual hierarchy. For example, I made the titles and headers for cards and pages bigger and other text smaller. 

4.To improve the alignment of the listing cards on the home page and hosted listings page, I used grid and set breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
